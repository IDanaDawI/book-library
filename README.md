## Introduction

This is the second project for the Front-end Web development nanodegree offered by Udacity with the Egyptian Ministry of Communication as a sponsor.

The project _MyReads: A Book Tracking App_ can't be described much better than how it is introduced in Udacity as follows:

> In the MyReads project, you'll create a bookshelf app that allows you to select and categorize books you have read, are currently reading, or want to read. The project emphasizes using React to build the application and provides an API server and client library that you will use to persist information as you interact with the application.
>> We will make use of an external api called booksAPI.js file that comes with the starter template to interact with the backend API.

## Installation Steps

Step 0 Make sure that node and npm is installed through the terminal

```terminal
node -v
npm -v
```

Step 1 If you have a specific directory go to your directory by writing the following in the terminal

```terminal
cd <project-directory>
```

Step 2 You can either start from scratch or clone the repository already offered by the Udacity team through

```terminal
git clone udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter
```

Step 3 Lets initialise our working directory and install the needed loaders and plugins

```terminal
npm install

```

## The muse

The online book reading application Wattpad, gave the coloring muse for my project.
